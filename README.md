Sendgrid on OpenShift
======================

This git repository helps you to send emails quickly and easily through SendGrid on OpenShift using PHP.


Running on OpenShift
----------------------------

Create an SendGrid account at http://sendgrid.com/pricing.html

Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/ and set up you local machine with the client tools.

Create a php-5.3 application (you can call your application whatever you want)
```
    rhc app create -a sendgrid -t php-5.3 --from-code git://github.com/sendgrid/openshift-sendgrid-php.git
```
If `--from-code` is not recognized, update your `rhc` gem.

Application code will be in `sendgrid` (or whatever you named your application).

Create custom environment variables in OpenShift
```
   rhc set-env sendgrid_user=<username> sendgrid_password=<password> -a sendgrid
```
Set username and password based on what you used to sign up for a SendGrid account and use the application name used to create your app.

### Configuration

Configure `php/send_email.php` file with your information:

Update your email address, subject, text content and html content:
```php
    $mail->
          addTo('foo@bar.com')->
          setFrom('me@bar.com')->
          setSubject('Subject goes here')->
          setText('Hello World!')->
          setHtml('Hello World!');
```
Then push the repo
```
    git add .
    git commit -m "my first commmit"
    git push
```
That's it, you can now checkout your application at:
```
    http://sendgrid-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com
```
